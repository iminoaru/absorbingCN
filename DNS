- The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. 
- Humans access information online through domain names, like google.com or espn.com. 
- Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 
- DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
- Maintained by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
- Operates on Port 53.
- A domain can never be brought, it can only be rented.

- DNS is the IP addresses in the named forms,
- Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device.
  DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), 
  or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

maps.google.com  
    maps    ->  sub domain
    google  ->  second level domain   (SLD)
    com     ->  top/root level domain (TLD)

- Multiple databases are there around the world for these 3 categories of domains.
- .com , .io , .org etc are stored in root DNS servers.
    
 -----------------------------------------------------WORKING OF DNS------------------------------------------------------------- 

When we search any website on internet then first it searches the corrosponding IP address of the website in your local
computer because when we visit a website for the first time then the IP address of it is stored in the computer's cache memory.
If it is not found in there then it is transfered to the Local DNS server ie. our Internet service provider, the ISP have the
information of all the websites we have visited even in incognito mode. if not found there then it is transfered to the root 
server, if it is not found there then it is returned to the ISP and then ISP finally transferes the request to the TLD and then
the IP address is returned to the ISP and then redirected to the desired website.
