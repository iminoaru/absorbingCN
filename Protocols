TCP/IP Protocols are sets of rules for message formats and procedures that allow machines and application programs to exchange 
information. These rules must be followed by each machine involved in the communication in order for the receiving host to be 
able to understand the message. 


HTTP (HyperTExt Transfer Protocol) :-
		- It is the protocol that allows web servers and browsers to exchange data over the web.
		- It is by default on TCP port 80.
		- It is stateless means each request is considered as the new request.
	
	HTTP methods :- 
			GET      - It requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
			HEAD     - It asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.
			POST     - It submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
			PUT      - It replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
			DELETE   - It deletes the specified resource.
			CONNECT  - It establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
			OPTIONS  - It describes the communication options for the target resource.
			TRACE    - It performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
			PATCH    - It applies partial modifications to a resource.
	
	HTTP Error/Status codes :-  
			100 – 199  ->  Informational responses 
			200 – 299  ->  Successful responses 
			300 – 399  ->  Redirection messages 
			400 – 499  ->  Client side error responses 
			500 – 599  ->  Server side error responses 
			
			
DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) :- 
  	- DHCP is a network protocol that is used to configure network devices to communicate on an IP network.
		- Allocates IP addresses to the devices connected to your network, also allocates subnet mask and default gateway. 

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) :- 
		- FTP is a way to download, upload and transfer files from one location to another on the Internet and between computer systems.
		- FTP enables the transfer of files back and forth between computers or through the cloud.
		- Users require an Internet connection in order to execute FTP transfers.
		- FTP works by opening two connections that link the computers trying to communicate with each other.

SSH (Secure Shell) :- 
		- SSH is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. 
		- It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and it protects communications security and integrity 
		with strong encryption.
		- When a client connects to a server over SSH, the machine can be controlled like a local computer.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) :-  *Not a TCP*
		- UDP is a communications protocol that is primarily used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections 
		between applications on the internet. 
		- UDP speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.
		Packets can be lost in transmission of data.
		- UDP is used when some data loss is managable like in video chats where some frame drops are considered normal.

NTP (Network Time Protocol) :-
		- It is used to synchronize the clocks on our computer to one standard time source. 
		- It is very useful in situations like bank transactions.
		- The server can crash very badly if it’s out of sync.
		- port 123 is used for NTP server communication and NTP clients use port 1023.
		
--------------------------------------------------------COOKIES------------------------------------------------------------------

Cookies are unique strings set by the server that are stored on the client's browser memory.
These cookies help the server to store the changes/requests that were made previously by the client.
Ex - recent logins, items added to cart, theme choosen on a webpage.
Cookies expire after a certain period of time.

The webpage asks for cookie for the very first time you open that page and then that cookie is stored in that browser on that PC.
It works like when a client makes a request to the server, the request is sent by the name of cookie like the client is identified
by the cookie (that unique string) and then that cookie is matched in the database of the and then the server responses with the 
requests made by that particular cookie, like when you open amazon then the amazon cookie will be sent to the server and then it 
will be matched by the database and then that unique webpage of that cookie will be given in response to the client by the server.

Third party cookies :- 
these are the websites that are indirectly using the cookie data of the client, like if you allow cookies on a news website and
that website have ads of other websites then those websites might use your cookie data too, this can lead to privacy hinderance.

---------------------------------------------------------EMAIL-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Emails are generally transfered by using 2 protocols SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and POP (PostOffice protocol)

-  SMTP is a push protocol and is used to send the mail. 
-  POP or IMAP (internet message access protocol) is used to retrieve those emails at the receiver’s side.

SMTP :-
	- SMTP is an application layer protocol. 
	- The client who wants to send the mail opens a TCP connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection. 
	- The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. 
	- As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection. 
	- It uses port 25. 
	- After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.
	- Message goes from sender's device to sender's SMTP server then to reciever's SMTP server and then to reciever's server.	

POP :-
	- The e-mail client requests new messages from the e-mail server, and the server “pops” all new messages out for the client.
	- It supports download and delete functions even when offline.
	- It requires no mail gateways due to its native nature.
	- It uses port 110. 
	- POP can handle email access only while the emails are sent by SMTP.
	- POP fetches the Email from the reciever's server and delivers it to the reciever's mailbox.
	- It is not synced with folders like drafts, sent Emails, bins.

IMAP :-
	- Basically helps to see and manage emails from multiple devices.
	- Like if an Email is deleted through phone then it will be deleted in the inbox of PC too.
