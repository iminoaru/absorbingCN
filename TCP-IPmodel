TCP/IP was designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s and is based on standard protocols. 
It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model.
This model is the practical implementation of the theoritical OSI model.

Session layer and Presentation layer comes under the Application layer in this model.
3G, 4G, LTE are examples of implementations of TCP/IP model.
The basic difference between TCP and IP is that IP finds the destination of the mail and TCP has the work to 
send and receive the mail. IP is required by TCP only.

UDP is another protocol, which does not require IP to communicate with another computer.

1. Application Layer           transferred over the network. Also acts as a gateway to access network.

Diff. b/w network layer and transport layer - 
    The work of network layer is to transfer the data across diffferent networks(different devices) whereas the work of
    transport layer is to transfer the data from that network to the particular application that is responsible for 
    recieving and sending the message, Ex Whatsapp, telegram.
       S1 - transfer the data from sender's app to the sender's network through transport layer.
       S2 - transfer the data from sender's network to the reciever's network through network layer.
       S3 - transfer the data from reciever's network to the reciever's app through transport layer.

Protocols used in each layer :-
          Application layer  ->  HTTP, SSH, NTP 
          Transport layer    ->  TCP, UDP
          Network layer      ->  IP
          DataLink Layer     ->  PPP, IEEE
          Physical Layer     ->  Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) Token Ring, RS-232
          
Networking devices used in each layer :-
          Application layer  ->  PC, Phone, Server 
          Transport layer    ->  Gateways, firewall
          Network layer      ->  Routers, Bridges
          DataLink Layer     ->  Bridges, switches, NIC
          Physical Layer     ->  Hubs, cables, modem , repeaters 
          
Type of data in each layer :-
          Application layer  ->  Raw Data 
          Transport layer    ->  Segments
          Network layer      ->  Packets
          DataLink Layer     ->  Frames
          Physical Layer     ->  Bits         
          
Checksum :- (Transport Layer)
          It is a method to check if any error like missing segments or corrupted file have taken place while the transmission of data. 
          In checksum the sender's end computes a numerical value according to the number of set or unset bits in a message 
          and sends it along with each message frame. At the receiver's end, the same checksum function (formula) is applied to the 
          message frame to retrieve the numerical value. If the numeric value at the reciever's side matches with the value at the
          sender's side then the data is successfully transmitted without any loss.

Timers :- (Transport Layer)
          A timer is a parameter that specifies the number of seconds that a Process waits on a TCP or UDP data read before the 
          Process is cancelled and put in timer retry status. when the packets are transfered then to know if the packet is recieved 
          or not we set a timer. A timer starts when the packet is sent and stops when the signal from reciever is recieved, this
          timer starts and stops for each packet transfer. When a packet is not reciever then the recieved signal is not sent so the
          timer expires and then it resends the packet. Now if the packet is recieved but the recieved signal is not sent then the 
          timer will expire and packet will be sent again but now the same packet is sent twice, this could result in server and network
          crash as the same packet is being transfered many times, to solve this each Packet is assigned a sequence number and the same 2
          sequence number packets can't be recieved and if recieved then the recieved signal is automatically sent to the timer.
          The number of seconds can range from 0â€“32767. The default value is 300.

Hop-by-Hop Transport :- (Network Layer)
          It is a dynamic method of transmission, Each router maintains a routing table of the next-hop neighbor for each destination, and incoming 
          packets are routed based on this table. If there is a failure in the network, the intradomain routing protocol (OSPF or IS-IS) operates in a 
          distributed manner and updates these routing tables at each router within the domain. The data transmits from router to router till destination.
          A routing Table consists of ever destination address. A forwarding table consists of only one destination where you want to send the data to, 
          it comes under routing table and both these tables are inside the router.
          All this network between the routers and these tables is built by the control plane, the network behaves as a graph where the routers act as
          nodes and the connections between the routers act as the edges. 
          2 Types of routings are - 
                    Static Routing  - Done manually
                    Dynamic Routing - Uses algorithms like Dijkstra, Bellman Ford to create the tables.
